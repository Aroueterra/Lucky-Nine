Windows:

```

*Note: Site doesn't support back button for reloading. Game is only properly reset when accessed through the index or the end.php page is reached!

## Known Issues

Known bugs: Ocassionally it says on page posting that the memory to be allocated exceeds the memory limit of PHP. Could be related to the DRAW result, theoretically, it should work..
